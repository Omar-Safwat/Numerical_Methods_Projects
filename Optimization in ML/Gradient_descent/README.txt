Structure:
==========
Gradient_descent.py : Python script contains custom-built classes implementing the following gradient descent algorithms.
  * Vanilla gradient descent
  * Mini batch gradient descent
  * Momentum gradient descent
  * Nesterov gradient descent

Linear_Regression.py : Python script builds Linear regression model using gradient descent classes, defined in "Gradient_descent.py"

Practical_1.ipynb, Practical_2.ipynb, Practical_3.ipynb : Jupyter notebooks solves practical lab tasks. The notebooks need to import "Linear_Regression.py" module in order to work. Module must be located in the same directory as the notebooks.

RegData.csv, MultipleLR.csv : Data sets used in notebooks, and must be located in the same directory as the notebooks.
